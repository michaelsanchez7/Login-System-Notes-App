# Login-System-Notes-App

Hi, this is my first public project. It is a barebones, yet functioning, backend log-in system and notes application. The log-in system is all handled within one class and reads credentials from a single .CSV file. The notes application is also handled within one file. It is "user" based, meaning you can only write to and read from the file created under your username. You can create as many user as you would like, and all "username".TXT files will be stored within a directory called "notes". This directory is created upon the first creation of any note from any user. 

Overall, this took me about 4 days to create, working on it a few hours here and there per day. It was a fun little personal project, and I just wanted to get some more practice in with BufferedReader and FileWriter.
